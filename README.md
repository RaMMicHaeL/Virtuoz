Virtuoz was designed to be a minimal and robust program that allows to have more than one desktop on Windows. It was inspired by [Sysinternals Desktops](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc817881.aspx), but uses a different approach, which doesnâ€™t impose the limitations which Desktops is bound to.
